```
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add <Your Name> to contributors list"
```

- *Push Changes to Your Fork*: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command:
```
git push origin main
```

- *Create a Pull Request*: Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, navigate to the repository on GitHub. You should see a notification prompting you to create a pull request. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button, provide a brief description of your changes, and submit your pull request.

- *Sync Your Fork*: To ensure your forked repository stays up-to-date with the original repository, click on the "Fetch upstream" button on your forked repository's GitHub page.

- *Wait for Review and Merge*: Sit tight and wait for a member of our team to review your pull request. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main project.
